Stock shares
A company's stock share is a piece of the company; more precisely:

A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a 
corporation. This Entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares."

An investor can buy a stock and sell it later. If the stock price increases, the investor profits. If it decreases, the investor will incur a loss.
Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. 
People trade stocks throughout the day. The stock ticker is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock market exchanges. 
In this project, you will use the y-finance API to obtain the stock ticker and extract information about the stock abd then visualize the result using MatPlotLib.
